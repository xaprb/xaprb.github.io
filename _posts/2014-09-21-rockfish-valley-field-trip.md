The Field Trip was led by long time Trail&nbsp;expert, Walt Childs, with advanced scouting provided by Marshall Faintich. The first half hour of the trip was stationary in the Trail parking area as the group was treated to an impromptu hawk watch as resting Broad-Wing Hawks rose from the nearby woods on their migration journey. Throughout the morning&nbsp;raptors kept appearing making for a great day. Shortly after leaving the parking area, the group came across a feeding flock of warblers which kept everyone busy as the birds darted in and out of the leaves. Eventually, the group had to call it a day although the bird sightings never let up. Thanks Walt and Marshall for hosting a great trip.(ed. note: Marshall actually had a little different experience as he tried to scout ahead for us.
