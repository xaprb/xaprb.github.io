On the Maury River just south of the Route 60 bridge outside of Buena Vista, he spotted a Red Necked Grebe. &nbsp;They have been showing up throughout the state, no doubt due to all of the frozen lakes up north. &nbsp;Thus far, this is the first one spotted in Rockbridge County.<br />I went by this morning and it was still there in the same place, closer to the bridge than the dam. &nbsp;It is hanging out with a Pied-Billed Grebe and is close to having full breeding plumage. Also on the river here were 5 American Wigeons, several Mallards, a Great Blue Heron, and Phoebe<br /><em style="">Kerry Kilday</em><br /></div>
