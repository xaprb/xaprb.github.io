<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><br />Six birders attended the monthly First Saturday&nbsp;Bird Walk today at Boxerwood. While the sky was overcast for the entire time, the slowly rising temperature seemed to activate the birds as the morning progressed with many new species seen in the Children's Playground and near the Parking Area at the end of the Walk. Highlights included several less common (for this area) winter birds including a well viewed Black-Capped Chickadee, single shivering Catbird, and several Purple Finches.&nbsp;<br /><span style=""><br />Boxerwood Gardens - MRR03, Rockbridge, US-VA</span><br /><span style="">Feb 7, 2015 8:00 AM -&nbsp;</span><span style=""><span style="">10:00 AM</span></span><br /><span style="">Protocol: Traveling</span><br /><span style="">1.0 mile(s)</span><br /><span style="">Comments:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Low 30's; overcast</span><br /><span style="">27 species</span><br /><br /><span style="">Turkey Vulture&nbsp; 1</span><br /><span style="">Mourning Dove&nbsp; 6</span><br /><span style="">Red-bellied Woodpecker&nbsp; 4</span><br /><span style="">Yellow-bellied Sapsucker&nbsp; 2</span><br /><span style="">Downy Woodpecker&nbsp; 8</span><br /><span style="">Northern Flicker&nbsp; 1</span><br /><span style="">Pileated Woodpecker&nbsp; 3</span><br /><span style="">Blue Jay&nbsp; 12</span><br /><span style="">American Crow&nbsp; 8</span><br /><span style="">Common Raven&nbsp; 1</span><br /><span style="">Carolina Chickadee&nbsp; 11</span><br /><span style="">Black-capped Chickadee&nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Single bird well observed.
