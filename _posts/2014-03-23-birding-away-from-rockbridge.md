title: Birding away from rockbridge
---
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">On March 12 Kerry Kilday gave the club a great presentation on birding travel beyond Rockbridge. &nbsp;He focused on the different approaches to birding trips - some organized and some on your own, with excellent insights into the pro's and con's of each. They range from birding festivals with lots of viewing trips and also other events, to special guided trips both on and off shore, as well as just taking advantage of all of the promotional literature out there to plan a trip yourself.<br /><br />While I can't include the personal stories that added so much to the examples he gave us, I can post the slideshow he put together (which is really good and pretty self-explanatory). NOTE: you'll need Powerpoint to view it, and its a pretty big file, so think about your internet connection when you click to download it.<br /><br />If you take advantage of any of these options we hope you'll let us know about your own experiences.</div>  <div><div style="margin: 10px 0 0 -10px"> <a href="/uploads/2/6/7/8/26780846/birding_presentation.ppt"><img src="http://www.weebly.com/weebly/images/file_icons/xls.png" width="36" height="36" style="float: left; position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px; margin: 0 15px 15px 0; border: 0;" /></a><div style="float: left; text-align: left; position: relative;"><table style="font-size: 12px; font-family: tahoma; line-height: .9;"><tr><td colspan="2"><b> birding_presentation.ppt</b></td></tr><tr style="display: none;"><td>File Size:  </td><td>11334 kb</td></tr><tr style="display: none;"><td>File Type:  </td><td> ppt</td></tr></table><a href="/uploads/2/6/7/8/26780846/birding_presentation.ppt" style="font-weight: bold;">Download File</a></div> </div>  <hr style="clear: both; width: 100%; visibility: hidden"></hr></div>
