title: Spring?
---
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">There has been some talk the last few days about new birds arriving at feeders in the area. &nbsp;Even with the (endless) snow and cold, the seasons are actually changing as longer days are joined by new arrivals and familiar songs not heard in months.<br />Several of us are seeing Fox Sparrows that have been absent for a while (though others have hosted them scratching beneath feeders throughout the winter).</div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/2/6/7/8/26780846/3742750_orig.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:1024px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The flashes of color as breeding plumage develops (we had an electric goldfinch yesterday) against the backdrop of snow also offer some hope.<br /><em>Bob Biersack</em></div>
