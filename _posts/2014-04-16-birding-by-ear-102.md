<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">After completing Donna Finnegan's 'Birding by Ear 101' on April 8, a group of 13 birders met at Boxerwood on Saturday to work on Professor Rowe's Birding by Ear 102.<br />Kerry Kilday and Dick Rowe led us through the nature center finding lots of great birds. It was a great example of birding by ear, with several identified as they sang in the distance. &nbsp;There were others we were able to seek out and get glimpses after someone recognized the song, and also some great examples of songs and hints we heard about from Donna.<br /><br />Here is the list of what we saw and heard;<br /><br />Ruby-crowned Kinglet&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;heard&nbsp;also seen by some<br /><span style=""></span>Eastern Meadowlark&nbsp;- heard<br />Field Sparrow&nbsp;- heard<br />Song Sparrow&nbsp;- heard<br />Carolina Wren&nbsp;- heard<br />American Crow&nbsp;- heard<br />Chipping Sparrow&nbsp;- heard<br />House Finch&nbsp;&ndash; heard<br />Common Grackle&nbsp;- heard<br /><br />Northern Cardinal&nbsp;&ndash; Heard/Seen<br />Tufted Titmouse&nbsp;&ndash; Heard/Seen<br />Mourning Dove&nbsp;Heard/seen<br /><br /><span style=""></span>Blue Jay<br /><span style=""></span>Red-bellied Woodpecker<br />Downy Woodpecker<br /><span style=""></span>American Robin<br />Eastern Bluebird<br /><span style=""></span>Green Heron<br /><span style=""></span>Swamp Sparrow<br /><span style=""></span>White-throated Sparrow<br /><span style=""></span>Tree Swallow<br /><span style=""></span>Carolina Chickadee<br /><span style=""></span>European Starling<br /><span style=""></span>Brown Thrasher<br /><span style=""></span>Northern Mockingbird<br /><span style=""></span>American Goldfich<br /><span style=""></span>Chimney Swift (first of the season fur us)<br /><span style=""></span>Yellow-rumped Warbler<br /><span style=""></span>Brown-headed Cowbird<br /><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span></div>
