<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Nine birders had a productive early spring morning at Boxerwood. While the sky was overcast, the birds were in full song. Along with the year round residents and a few continuing winter visitors, the group enjoyed watching a First of Season Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher interacting with an annoyed Ruby-Crowned Kinglet.
