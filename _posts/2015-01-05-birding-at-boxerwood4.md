title: Birding at boxerwood
---
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">After two days of postponement, six Bird Club members enjoyed a sunny but chilly morning at Boxerwood today. While things started out pretty quiet, the end tally of 23 species was pretty respectable. Highlight of the morning was a Hermit Thrush who would rather be heard than seen, although ultimately we all got good looks at him. Also an adult Red-Tailed Hawk took to flight which resulted in flushing out a flock of Robins for the day.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Kieran Kilday</em><br /><br />Boxerwood Gardens - MRR03, Rockbridge, US-VA<br />Jan 5, 2015 8:00 AM - 9:15 AM<br />Protocol: Traveling<br />1.0 mile(s)<br />Comments: &nbsp; &nbsp; Sunny, 35 degrees, gusty winds<br />23 species<br /><br />Black Vulture &nbsp;1<br />Turkey Vulture &nbsp;12<br />Red-shouldered Hawk &nbsp;1<br />Red-tailed Hawk &nbsp;1<br />Mourning Dove &nbsp;19<br />Red-bellied Woodpecker &nbsp;1<br />Yellow-bellied Sapsucker &nbsp;1<br />Downy Woodpecker &nbsp;3<br />Northern Flicker &nbsp;1<br />Blue Jay &nbsp;14<br />American Crow &nbsp;12<br />Carolina Chickadee &nbsp;12<br />Tufted Titmouse &nbsp;10<br />White-breasted Nuthatch &nbsp;6<br />Carolina Wren &nbsp;7<br />Hermit Thrush &nbsp;1<br />American Robin &nbsp;13<br />Northern Mockingbird &nbsp;3<br />European Starling &nbsp;8<br />Eastern Towhee &nbsp;1<br />White-throated Sparrow &nbsp;12<br />Northern Cardinal &nbsp;1<br />American Goldfinch &nbsp;12<br />--&nbsp;<br /><br /></div>
