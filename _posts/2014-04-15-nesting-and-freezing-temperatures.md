title: nesting and freezing temperatures
---
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I returned home yesterday after a long weekend away to discover three beautiful bluebird eggs in one of the nest boxes I&rsquo;ve been monitoring; today, the hen laid a fourth. I am wondering what effect tonight&rsquo;s below-freezing temperature might have on the eggs. Will they freeze and not be viable? Does cold in some way stunt embryonic development? I&rsquo;ve been googling for information, but coming up with little that's relevant. Most temperature studies are focused on heat. Does anyone in the club know?&nbsp;<br /><br />Leave a comment if you have suggestions - thanks<br /><span style=""></span><br /><em>Bonnie Bernstein<br /></em><span style=""></span><br /><br /></div>
