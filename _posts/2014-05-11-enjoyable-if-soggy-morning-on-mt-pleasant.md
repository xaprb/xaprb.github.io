title: enjoyable, if soggy morning on Mt. Pleasant

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Kerry Kilday lead 16 bird watchers on a lovely walk at Bruce and Nancy Summers place in the Mt. Pleasant National Scenic Area this morning. We were at about 2700 ft. elevation on the slopes of Bald Knob according to Bruce. Around the house we heard Wood Thrush and Ovenbird and saw as well as heard a Gray Catbird, Eastern Bluebird and a Chipping Sparrow which, as we watched, plucked several plastic strings from a larger bird's nest and headed off with them to probably use them for it's own nest construction.<br /><br />We headed up a lovely trail, flanked by the soft green canopy of new leaf growth. With wildflowers at our feet and bird song in the trees it was a delightful mix of looking up and looking down as we walked on Bruce's masterfully maintained trails. We reluctantly turned around when the rain drops became a steady downpour. Luckily we were able to take refuge in Nancy &amp; Bruce's warm, dry and welcoming home.<br /><br />Here are the birds we identified:<br />At the Food Lion parking lot:<br />Fish Crow<br />Kildeer<br />At Summers place:<br />Indigo Bunting<br />Gray Catbird<br />Wood Thrush<br />Ovenbird<br />Eastern Bluebird<br />American Goldfinch<br />Chipping Sparrow<br />Red-eyed Vireo<br />Blue Jay<br />Woodpecker (Downy or Hairy)<br />Red-bellied Woodpecker<br />Scarlet Tanager<br />Hermit Thrush<br />Northern Cardinal<br />Blue-headed Vireo<br />American Redstart<br />Eastern Towhee<br />Eastern Phoebe<br />Common Crow<br /><br /><br /><em>Wendy Richards</em><br /><br /></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/2/6/7/8/26780846/2538243_orig.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:392px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Photo by Lad Sessions</div>
