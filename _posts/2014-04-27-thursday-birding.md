<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">On April 24, a group of five headed to the Locher Tract and later, up Petite's Gap to the Parkway to see what was about. &nbsp;Locher was loaded with Blue-Gray Gnatcatchers, along with a Great Crested Flycatcher, Louisiana Waterthrush, Red Winged Blackbirds, Blue Headed Vireos and several more of the usual suspects. We decided to drive up Petite's Gap in search of Warblers and weren't disappointed with good looks at a Black Throated Green and the songs of several more. The highlight of that drive may have been the unexpected sound, and sight of a Ruffed Grouse as it left a small clearing on the road just after we stopped to look around. Next week we're thinking perhaps one more try at a lower altitude, unless the canopy fills in a lot more this week. Perhaps the Chessie Trail. &nbsp;We leave from the old K-Mart parking lot at 7, and everyone i<div>Here is our list from the morning - more or less in order of their appearance;</div><div>Northern Cardinal</div><div>Great Crested Flycatcher&nbsp;</div><div>Tufted Titmouse</div><div>Red Bellied Woodpecker</div><div>Cowbird</div><div>White Breasted Nuthatch</div><div>American Crow</div><div>Blue Headed Vireo</div><div>Yellow Rump Warbler</div><div>Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher</div><div>Red-Winged Blackbird</div><div>Tree Swallow</div><div>Carolina Wren</div><div><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5;">American Goldfinch</span></div><div>White-Throated Sparrow</div><div>Pileated Woodpecker</div><div>Raven</div><div>Eastern Phoebe</div><div>Downy Woodpecker</div><div>Dark-Eyed Junco</div><div>Eastern Bluebird</div><div>Turkey Vulture</div><div>Field Sparrow</div><div>Ruffed Grouse</div><div>American Robin</div><div>Black and White Warbler</div><div>Hooded Warbler</div><div>Black-Throated Green Warbler</div><div>Ovenbird</div><div>Mourning Dove</div><div>Rough-Winged Swallow</div><div><br></div></div>
