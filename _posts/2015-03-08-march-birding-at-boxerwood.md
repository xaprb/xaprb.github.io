title: March Birding at boxerwood
---
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">A small group of birders (3) enjoyed a bright sunny morning for First Saturday Bird Walk at Boxwood on March 7th. Among the birds seen were some nice winter representatives (many Pine Siskins and Purple Finches) and some early spring arrivals (Red-Winged Blackbirds) as well as the usual suspects. The feeders were definitely the hubs of activities, but other interesting sightings were found throughout the property.
