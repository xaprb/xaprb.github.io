title: november birding at boxerwood

<div class="paragraph"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Seven birders enjoyed a clear crisp morning at Boxerwood. The Red Breasted Nuthatches which have been seen for several months now, were first heard and then spotted almost as soon as we gathered at the Parking area. Others were later seen down by the Lodge. Highlight of the morning was an excellent views of a single Fox Sparrow patiently waiting on a branch for all binoculars to spot it surrounded by a huge flock of White Throated Sparrows, the high count bird of the day. Also, a circling Sharp-Shinned Hawk was spotted in the field, giving a nice opportunity to check out the key ID features.&nbsp;<br /></span><span>Boxerwood Nature Center &amp; Woodland Garden, Rockbridge, Virginia, US</span><br /><span>Dec 3, 2016 7:45 AM - 9:35 AM</span><br /><span>Protocol: Traveling</span><br /><span>1.0 mile(s)</span><br /><span>Comments:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Clear but cold (36)</span><br /><span>25 species</span><br /><br /><span>Black Vulture&nbsp; 2</span><br /><span>Turkey Vulture&nbsp; 25</span><br /><span>Sharp-shinned Hawk&nbsp; 1</span><br /><span>Rock Pigeon (Feral Pigeon)&nbsp; 6</span><br /><span>Red-bellied Woodpecker&nbsp; 1</span><br /><span>Yellow-bellied Sapsucker&nbsp; 1</span><br /><span>Downy Woodpecker&nbsp; 3</span><br /><span>Northern Flicker&nbsp; 2</span><br /><span>Blue Jay&nbsp; 8</span><br /><span>American Crow&nbsp; 6</span><br /><span>Carolina Chickadee&nbsp; 10</span><br /><span>Tufted Titmouse&nbsp; 10</span><br /><span>Red-breasted Nuthatch&nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;RBNU's have been present here for several months.
