title: Christmas Bird Count Sets Record
---
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The 88th annual Lexington Christmas Bird Count broke a record as well as a tradition. On the 21st of December about 40 volunteers spent an unusually warm count day tallying a record 80 species (the previous high count was 79 species in 1979).&nbsp;<br /><br />Dick Rowe, the compiler and coordinator of the event, moved the count day forward from December 26th, the date it has traditionally been held. Since 1974 the count has been centered on Big Spring, located along Rt. 60 west of Lexington.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span> The unusual species identified this year included a Merlin, spotted in the Rockbridge Baths area; a Common Goldeneye at Big Spring; and 7 Bald Eagles seen at Lake Merriweather. Also of note, there was a large flock of Rusty Blackbirds seen near South River. This species is one that has experienced a notable decline in recent years. You can read Dick&rsquo;s full report on the Count in the December 31st issue of the News-Gazette<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span></div>
